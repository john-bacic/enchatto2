Solutions to Prevent Freezing:

1. Enable Automatic Reconnection in Socket.IO

Ensure that the client-side Socket.IO is set to automatically reconnect when the app returns to the foreground:

const socket = io({
  reconnection: true, // Automatically reconnect
  reconnectionAttempts: 10, // Retry up to 10 times
  reconnectionDelay: 1000, // Start with 1s delay
  reconnectionDelayMax: 5000, // Max delay of 5s
  timeout: 20000 // Wait 20s before failing
});


2. Detect When the App Comes Back to the Foreground

Use the Page Visibility API to detect when the user returns to the app and then attempt to reconnect manually:

document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === "visible") {
    console.log("App is back in focus, checking socket connection...");
    if (!socket.connected) {
      socket.connect();
    }
  }
});


3. Handle "disconnect" and Reconnect Explicitly

Listen for the disconnect event and attempt a manual reconnection:

socket.on("disconnect", (reason) => {
  console.warn("Socket disconnected:", reason);
  if (reason === "transport close" || reason === "ping timeout") {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Attempting to reconnect...");
      socket.connect();
    }, 2000);
  }
});


4. Use Background Sync (for Critical Messages)

If your app needs to process real-time data even when in the background, consider Background Sync API (for PWA) or Push Notifications:

navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then((registration) => {
  console.log('Service Worker registered', registration);
});


5. Optimize WebSocket Server to Allow Reconnections

If you control the server, make sure that it allows reconnecting clients to recover their previous session:

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("A user connected:", socket.id);

  socket.on("disconnect", (reason) => {
    console.log(`User ${socket.id} disconnected: ${reason}`);
  });

  socket.on("reconnect", (attemptNumber) => {
    console.log(`User ${socket.id} reconnected after ${attemptNumber} attempts`);
  });
});
