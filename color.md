Change the guest's chat messages and translations to match the guest colour which is derived from server.js. 

So the guest's massage original text and translated text should match their room-info-language, usernaem and send button colour. Keep the guest's background the colour it is now.

For the Host keep their colour as is including background colour and text colour. 

Each user should have a distinct colour for their text to match their room-info-language, usernaem and send button colour.

Keep the colours consistent across the app.
Keep the host's background the colour it is now.
Keep the guest's background the colour it is now.
keep the host's text the colour it is now.

Rewrite the CSS and javascript code to make this possible.
